# Decoding Workforce Churn (Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

This project simulates the role of a data analyst exploring workforce attrition trends. Using real-world HR data, the goal was to uncover meaningful insights into why employees leave — and lay the foundation for data-driven retention strategies.

🎯 **Objective**

Organizations often struggle to retain top talent due to unclear visibility into attrition drivers. This project aimed to:

- Perform in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on employee data  
- Identify patterns and factors contributing to workforce churn  
- Visualize trends to inform data-driven decision-making  
- Guide future predictive modeling or retention strategies

---

🔧 **Tech Stack**

- **Python** – Data analysis and exploration  
- **Pandas / NumPy** – Data wrangling  
- **Seaborn / Matplotlib** – Visualizations  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis and storytelling

---

🛠️ **Key Features**

✅ Cleaned and explored employee demographic and job-related data  
✅ Identified top attrition signals such as OverTime and Job Role  
✅ Visualized correlations between job level, income, and satisfaction  
✅ Created categorical and numerical distributions to spot patterns  
✅ Built a foundation for predictive attrition modeling

✅ **Conclusion**

The exploratory data analysis revealed several meaningful patterns related to employee attrition:

- **OverTime** was one of the most influential factors — employees working overtime had a noticeably higher attrition rate. This suggests that excessive workload or poor work-life balance could be key drivers of resignation.
  
- **Job Roles** such as *Sales Executive* and *Laboratory Technician* had higher proportions of attrition compared to other roles. This indicates a need to assess role-specific challenges or support systems.

- **Marital Status** and **Gender** had some influence, but not as significant as OverTime and Job Role. However, they remain useful dimensions for segmenting attrition trends.

- **Education Field** didn’t show strong direct correlation with attrition but helped map the workforce composition and diversity of skills.

- The **correlation matrix** also revealed that features such as *Monthly Income* and *Job Level* were moderately related, but not direct indicators of attrition alone.

Overall, the EDA provided valuable insights into **what drives employees to leave**, identifying potential pain points in work conditions and role structures. These findings lay a strong foundation for future predictive modeling, targeted retention strategies, and workforce planning decisions.
